## Python

### Variable "rule of thumb"

- No Case
  - newvariable = 10
- Camel Case
  - newVariable = 10
- Snake Case
  - new_variable = 10
  - It became a rule of thumb in for language (Python)

#### NoneType Variable

- We can declare an empty variable by setting it to `None`
- We do set variable with `None` to use it later
  - Which means if the value of any variable is `None`, it hasn't been set yet

>Note: The None type is not the same as a string with a value of "None":

```
my_none = None # this is a None-type
my_none = "None" # this is a string
```

### String

- "Strings" are raw text in coding speak. They are called string because they are a list of characters "strung" (aik sath juray hoe) together.

### Notes

- **type** function
  - type(any_variable)
- **is** keyword
  - `is` is a keyword in Python that test if two variables refer to the same object. The test returns **True** if the two objects are the same object. The test returns **False** if they are not the same object, even if the two objects are 100% equal.
